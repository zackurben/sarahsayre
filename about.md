My name is Sarah and I am a photographer in Southern California. I enjoy many types of photography, but I am drawn to landscapes every time I pick up my camera. California provides the perfect opportunity to photograph everything including the beach, national parks, the desert, mountains, and cityscapes. I honestly feel so blessed to be able to capture the beauty around me.

Developing my own film has brought a whole new meaning to my photography and developing my own prints is my next endeavor. The darkroom and has become its own little oasis away from reality where I can focus on creating, experimenting, and exploring new techniques. I thank God for that. I am currently working on a book encompassing photographs of the Mojave Desert and deserted areas. Anticipated release: May 2022.
